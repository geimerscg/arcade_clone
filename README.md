# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Dependencies
All files required are included in the zipped folder.

## Instructions
To play the game simply locate index.html and use your favorite browser to open the file. Enemy girls will try to block your path to the river, but you must persist and reach the water.

## About the Code
The game functions by constantly repainting the browser to update the image similar to how animation was originally done.  Enemies will cross the screen at random speeds to block the player then reset after crossing. Players may move on screen in any direction but reset after a collision.
Each sprite is instantiated as a class and follows the specific movement patterns available. For specifics on each method available to the classes, the code has been commented to provide further details.
